# Web-Scraping
Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

# Database SQLite
  - ther is no need to data-base for Web-Scraping 
  - but if you want to perform analysis operation on the abstracted data then you need to store abstracted data in DataBase
  - in this Repository we have add [flipkart.sqlite](https://github.com/PartheOmkar/Web-Scraping/blob/main/Flipkart.sqlite) data base file for store data
  - if you want to change DataBase file then you have need to make some change's in [Flipkart.py](https://github.com/PartheOmkar/Web-Scraping/blob/main/Flipkart.py) file
  - you Dont need to create table in databse, once [Flipkart.py](https://github.com/PartheOmkar/Web-Scraping/blob/main/Flipkart.py) executed it's create table.
